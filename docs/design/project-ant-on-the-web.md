# ant-on-the-web

`ant-on-the-web` is the name for the website portion of the project. The
technology with which it will be written is not yet known, but some flavor of
Typescript with a corresponding framework.

## Goals

Ant on the web is the dashboarding area for the information/data the other parts
of the service will generate. These different types of data will be shown at
various routes.

The valid routes for the website will be:

- The main site (`typesofants.org`)
- Suggestions (`typesofants.org/suggestions`)
- Test suite passing/failing statuses (`typesofants.org/tests`)
- Software deployments (`typesofants.org/deployments`)
- Blog (`typesofants.org/blog`)
- Contact me/Information page (`typesofants.org/info`)
- Provisioning and host information (`typesofants.org/hosts`)
- [maybe] Read-only database and query submitter (`typesofants.org/data`)

## Architecture

Just a website. Some type of `node` app. No details.
