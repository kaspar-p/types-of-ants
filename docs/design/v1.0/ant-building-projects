# ant-building-projects

The deployment and building software.

## Requirements

It needs to be able to know if a project has changed. This can either be a push or pull method. Push would require the existence of an API, and pull would require some sort of CRON job cycle.

It then needs to pull the new changes, rebuild the project, stop the current program, and restart the program.

Building the project will be handled by the build system, like Bazel. Everything else is straightforward.

Deployment data will also need to be logged, to show on /deployments. Each step of the deployment will need to emit that data. The data includes:

- Timestamp of the start of the step
- Timestamp of the end of the step
- The version that it is upgrading from
- The version it is upgrading to
- The machine that it is deploying onto
- The project that is currently being deployed
