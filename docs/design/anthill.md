# Anthill

What is anthill? The build system, of course! The build system is really really
simple, but can grow into what is needed at the end.

It relies on the monorepository structure of the current types-of-ants
repository. Each project has an `anthill.json` file to talk about metadata for
that project.

Anthill, combined with ant-building-projects, is how new versions of the
software get vended!
