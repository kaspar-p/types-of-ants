# Contribution

Here at [typesofants.org](http://typesofants.org), we love the open-source nature of Github, and highly encourage pull-requests and issues for more types of ants! We will also consider removals in the case of offense being taken by a type of ant.

## Style

Two spaces == one tab

## Issues

Everything worth considering must be marked as `bug`. Naturally.

## Process

When making changes to the page, be sure to make changes to `generate/index_template.html`, rather than `index.html`. Then run the top-level `generate.sh` script to process those changes into an actual site. 

Making changes by adding more ants is simply done by editing `ants.txt` and running the `generate.sh` script.
