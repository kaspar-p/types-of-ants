# Fixing a Typo

If you've made a typo, there are 2 cases:

## 1. If the typo is included in a `releases/` release

Simply:

1. Fix the typo in the release `.json` file,
1. Fix the typo in the `ants.txt` file.
1. Recompile with `./bin/generate_site`, and you're done!

## 2. If the typo was never included in a `releases/` release

Simply:

1. Fix the typo in the `ants.txt` file.
1. Recompile with `./bin/generate_site`, and you're done!
