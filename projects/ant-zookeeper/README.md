# ant-zookeeper

The ant-zookeeper project is managing ants of all different flavors. It is
mostly a formalization of things that were previously done in bash scripts. The
zookeeper talks to all different types of beasts, some stable, some unstable,
some need help frequently, others can be left alone for a good while. The
zookeeper is in charge of keeping the entire zoo running.

ant-zookeeper has the following planned capabilities:

1. Taking backups from databases and storing them in various `ant-fs`
   deployments.
