# ant-worker-metrics-exporter

A wrapper for [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter), the
Prometheus system's idiomatic exporter for disk usage, network usage, and other
per-host metrics.

There's a typesofants wrapper for the project because the deployment mechanism
is unique.
